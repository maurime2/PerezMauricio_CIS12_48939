If statements
Nice work on comparisons! Now let's see how we can use comparisons to ask yes or no questions.

Say we want to write a program that asks whether your name is longer than 7 letters. If the answer is yes, we can respond with "You have a long name!" We can do this with an if statement:

<?php
  $age = 17;

  if( $age > 16 ) {
    echo "You can drive!";
  }
?>
An if statement is made up of the if keyword, a condition like we've seen before, and a pair of curly braces { }. If the answer to the condition is yes, the code inside the curly braces will run.
