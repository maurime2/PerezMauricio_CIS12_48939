Great work! Now let's practice using if / else statements. Do as much as you can by yourself, but if you need a reminder, click the "Stuck? Get a hint!" button below.

Instructions
On line 8, write an if / else statement, just like we did in the last exercise. Here's what the outline of the code looked like:
<?php
  if (this condition is true) {
    // do this code
  }
  else {
    // do this code instead
  }
?>
If your condition is true, your code should echo "The condition is true"

Otherwise (else) when it is false, your code should echo "The condition is false".

Make sure your condition evaluates to false, so that your program prints out "The condition is false".
