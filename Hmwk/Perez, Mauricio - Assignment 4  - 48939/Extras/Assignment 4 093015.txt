Output the electromagnetic spectrum band from 10^3 to 10^-12 in 10^-1 increments.

Column 1 -> row number 1,2,3,4,5,6....to 16

Column 2 -> wavelength from 10^3 to 10^-12

Column 3 -> Band from radio to gamma

3 separate pages

1) no arrays (calculation and display has to be done simultaneously)

2) 1 - Dimension arrays (logic calculation then display)

3) 2 - Dimensional table (logic calculation then display) for those that already know how to program
