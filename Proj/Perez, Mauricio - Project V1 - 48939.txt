You have 2 projects to build

1)  A personal project such as a Business project complete with users, catalogs, shopping carts and an administrative side.

2)  Class project.  A survey engine.

Each project needs a design.

1)  Sitemap which will have 3 sections
      Public Interface
      Member Interface -> Login
      Admin Interface -> Login

Each Section is to have numerous web pages associated with it.  Your job for version 1 is to provide a sitemap and a pages for each section which for now just has the page description.

2)  Each project needs a data base design
     All tables and all fields in each table.  Just the design, no need to put in any data yet.

You are to use Github and a repository that has each version of your project.
