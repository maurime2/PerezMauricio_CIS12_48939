Now you need to implement your projects.

Create all your tables.  Fill them as we showed you how in class, refer to the repository.  I need a minimum of 5 tables with 100's to 1000's of records to test out your multiple table queries.

Also, create the queries you are going to need, ready for implementation,

As a reminder, here is what you need to create

You have 2 projects to build

1)  A personal project using the concepts in the course, such as a Business project complete with users, catalogs, shopping carts and an administrative side. 
2)  A survey engine project.

Each project needs a design.

1)  Sitemap which will have 3 sections
      Public Interface
      Member Interface -> Login
      Admin Interface -> Login

Each Section is to have numerous web pages associated with it.  Your job for version 1 is to provide a sitemap and a pages for each section which for now just has the page description.

2)  Each project needs a data base design
     All tables and all fields in each table.

You are to use Github and a repository that has each version of your project.
